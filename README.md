# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ChatGPT Web App

This project is a web-based chat application that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide a seamless and interactive chatting experience. The application allows users to send messages and receive responses from GPT-3.5, simulating a real conversation.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Real-time chat interface similar to modern messaging apps.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Integration**: Utilizes the GPT-3.5 API to generate human-like responses.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop use with a clean and intuitive layout.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handles errors and provides feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **CSS**: Styling the application for a clean and responsive design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/chatgpt-web-app.git
   cd chatgpt-web-app


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
